# Analogical Reasoning

## Purpose

Provide a framework for speaking meaningfully about transcendent realities (especially God) by distinguishing univocal, equivocal, and analogical predication. This enables meaningful theological language while preserving divine transcendence.


## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle


## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "How can we talk about God?"
- "What does it mean to say God is good?"
- "Isn't all God-talk meaningless?"
- "Religious language problems"
- "Can human concepts apply to God?"
- "What do divine attributes mean?"
- "How to speak of the infinite"
- "Theological language"

**Contexts:**
- Philosophy of religion discussions
- Questions about divine attributes
- Skeptical challenges to religious language
- Comparative theology (how traditions speak of ultimate reality)
- Mystical theology discussions
- Analyzing religious metaphors

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Term in question | The word or concept being applied to God | Yes |
| Context | How the term is being used | No |
| Concern | Specific worry about meaningful predication | No |
| Comparison | Creaturely vs. divine application | No |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Predication analysis | Whether the term is univocal, equivocal, or analogical |
| Mode clarification | How the term applies to God differently than creatures |
| Meaningful content | What can truly be affirmed |
| Limitations | What remains unknown |

### Recommendations

```


## Workflow
### Step 1: Understand the Three Modes of Predication

| Mode | Definition | Example | Problem for God-talk |
|------|------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Univocal** | Same meaning in all uses | "Animal" of dog and cat | Would make God just another being |
| **Equivocal** | Completely different meanings | "Bank" (river/financial) | Would make God-talk meaningless |
| **Analogical** | Related but different meanings | "Healthy" of body/medicine | Allows meaningful speech while preserving transcendence |

### Step 2: See Why Univocal Predication Fails

If "good" meant EXACTLY the same thing when said of God and creatures:
- God would be just one more good thing among others
- Divine transcendence would be lost
- God would be a being among beings, not Being Itself

**But**: Our concepts are formed from creaturely experience. We cannot have the same grasp of divine goodness as of human goodness.

### Step 3: See Why Equivocal Predication Fails

If "good" meant something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT when said of God:
- We could know nothing about God
- All theology would be meaningless
- Even revelation would communicate nothing

**But**: We can know something about God from effects (creatures bear traces of their cause).

### Step 4: Apply Analogical Predication

**The via analogiae** threads between univocal and equivocal:

**Analogy of Attribution:**
- A term applies primarily to one thing and derivatively to others
- "Healthy" applies properly to the animal; derivatively to medicine (causes health) and urine (indicates health)
- Applied to God: Perfections exist properly in God; derivatively in creatures (who participate in God's perfections)

**Analogy of Proportionality:**
- Similar relationships in different subjects
- As vision is to the eye, so understanding is to the mind
- Applied to God: As created goodness is to creatures, so infinite goodness is to God

### Step 5: Apply the Three Ways (Via Triplex)

For any term applied to God:

**Via Affirmativa (Way of Affirmation):**
- Affirm that God has the perfection (God IS good)
- Based on causality: effects resemble their causes
- We can truly say something positive about God

**Via Negativa (Way of Negation):**
- Deny that God has the perfection in the creaturely mode (God is not good as creatures are)
- Based on transcendence: God exceeds all creaturely categories
- We remove imperfections and limitations

**Via Eminentiae (Way of Eminence):**
- Affirm that God has the perfection in a supereminent way (God is good beyond all conception)
- Based on divine infinity: God possesses perfections in an unlimited manner
- The perfection exists in God more perfectly than we can conceive

### Step 6: Distinguish Res Significata from Modus Significandi

**Res significata** (thing signified): What the term refers to
**Modus significandi** (mode of signifying): How our concepts express it

For perfection terms applied to God:
- The res significata DOES apply to God (God really is good, wise, etc.)
- The modus significandi does NOT apply (our concepts are formed from creatures)

**Result:** We know THAT God is good, but not WHAT divine goodness is in itself.

## Example Application

**User question:** "When we say 'God loves us,' doesn't that just project human emotions onto God?"

**Analogical Reasoning Analysis:**

**Step 1 - Identify the predication:**
The term "love" is being applied to God. Is this univocal, equivocal, or analogical?

**Step 2 - Apply the via triplex:**

*Via Affirmativa:*
We can truly say God loves. This is not projection but recognition that:
- Effects resemble their causes
- Human love (with all its imperfections) reflects something real in God
- God really wills our good

*Via Negativa:*
God does not love as creatures do:
- Not with emotion that changes based on circumstances
- Not with passion that is moved by the beloved
- Not with limited capacity that must choose among objects

*Via Eminentiae:*
God loves in a supereminent way:
- God's love is identical with God's being (God IS love)
- God's love is perfectly constant, not variable
- God's love causes the goodness in creatures (rather than responding to it)

**Step 3 - Clarify the analogy:**

Human love and divine love are analogically related:
- **Similarity**: Both involve willing the good of another
- **Difference**: Human love is received and responsive; divine love is originative and constitutive

When we say "God loves," we mean:
- **Res significata**: God really does will our good (TRUE)
- **Modus significandi**: In a way that exceeds our emotional experience (DIFFERENT)

**Step 4 - Address the concern:**

This is not mere projection because:
1. We learned about love from human experience, but love itself is a perfection
2. Perfections exist primarily in God and derivatively in creatures
3. We are not imposing human categories on God but recognizing that our experience participates in something divine

**Conclusion:** "God loves us" is meaningful and true. It affirms that God wills our good (res significata) while acknowledging that divine love transcends human emotional experience (modus significandi). We know THAT God loves; we do not fully comprehend WHAT divine love is in itself.

## Key Distinctions

### Pure Perfections vs. Mixed Perfections

**Pure perfections:** Can be predicated of God (involve no imperfection in their concept)
- Being, goodness, wisdom, power, love, justice

**Mixed perfections:** Cannot be predicated of God literally (involve material or limited aspects)
- Walking, growing, digesting (involve bodily limitation)
- Said of God only metaphorically

### Negative vs. Positive Attributes

**Negative attributes:** Tell us what God is NOT
- Infinite (not limited), immutable (not changing), eternal (not temporal)

**Positive attributes:** Tell us what God IS
- Good, wise, powerful (but understood analogically)

Both are needed; neither alone is sufficient.

## Common Objections and Responses

### "This makes God-talk meaningless - we can't know what anything means about God"
We know THAT the perfections apply to God; we know they apply in a supereminent way. This is genuine knowledge, even if not comprehensive. Analogy yields true but incomplete knowledge.

### "Why not just use metaphor?"
Metaphor says God is LIKE something. Analogy says God really IS good, wise, etc. - not merely similar. The via affirmativa makes genuine ontological claims, not just comparisons.

### "This seems like having it both ways - affirming and denying the same thing"
We affirm that God has the perfection (res significata) while denying that our mode of understanding captures it (modus significandi). These are different claims and not contradictory.

### "Negative theology alone is more honest"
Pure negative theology would leave us knowing nothing positive about God. But revelation tells us God is good, loving, wise - not merely that God is not-evil, not-uncaring, not-foolish. Some positive content is preserved.

## Integration Notes

**Parent Expert:** thomas-aquinas

**Related Skills:**
- **five-ways-analysis**: Concludes to God's existence; analogical reasoning shows how to speak of what the Five Ways demonstrate
- **faith-reason-synthesis**: Analogy enables theology to make meaningful claims
- **scholastic-method**: Provides rigorous framework for analyzing analogical predication

**Skill Interaction:**
After establishing God's existence (five-ways-analysis), analogical reasoning addresses how we can meaningfully speak about this God. It bridges natural theology and revealed theology by showing how human language can (and cannot) express divine realities.
